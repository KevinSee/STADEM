\usage{
compileGRAdata(yr, spp = c("Chinook", "Steelhead"), dam = c("LWG"),
  damPIT = "GRA", strata_beg = NULL, start_day = NULL, end_day = NULL,
  incl_jacks = NULL, sthd_type = c("all", "unclipped"),
  sthd_B_run = FALSE, trap_path = NULL, useDARTrate = F,

}
\arguments{
\item{yr}{spawn year.}

\item{spp}{species to focus on. Currently the possible choices are: \code{Chinook} or \code{Steelhead}}

\item{dam}{the dam code. Currently only set up for Lower Granite (\code{LWG}). Other possible codes to be implemented in the future are: WFF (Willamette Falls), BON (Bonneville), TDA (The Dalles), JDA (John Day), MCN (McNary), IHR (Ice Harbor), LMN (Lower Monumental), LGS (Little Goose), LWG (Lower Granite), PRO (Prosser), ROZ (Roza), PRD (Priest Rapids), WAN (Wanapum), RIS (Rock Island), TUM (Tumwater), RRH (Rocky Reach), WEL (Wells), ZOS (Zosel)}

\item{damPIT}{the dam code for the dam you wish to query for PIT tag data. Currently only available for Lower Granite Dam (\code{GRA}).}

\item{strata_beg}{3 letter code for the day of the week each weekly strata should begin on.}

\item{start_day}{date (\code{month / day}) when query should start}

\item{end_day}{date (\code{month / day}) when query should end}

\item{incl_jacks}{should jacks be included in the window count totals? \code{T / F}}

\item{sthd_type}{should window counts of steelhead be for all steelhead, or only unclipped (i.e. wild) fish? Default is \code{all}.}

\item{sthd_B_run}{should numbers of B run steelhead be reported? These are defined as wild steelhead greater than 780mm in length. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{trap_path}{file path where a csv file containing the data from the fish trap is located}

\item{useDARTrate}{should the DART query for the trap rate be used? Default is \code{FALSE}, which implies the trap rate is estimated by PIT tags.}

\item{trap_rate_cv}{constant coefficient of variation (CV) that should be applied to estimates of trap rate queried by DART. Default value is \code{0}.}

\item{trap_rate_dist}{distributional form for trap rate prior. \code{beta} returns alpha and beta parameters for beta distribution. \code{logit} returns mean and standard deviation in logit space.}
